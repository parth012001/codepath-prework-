Submitted by: Parth Sureshbhai Ahir

Time spent: 3.5 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/marred-luck-power (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

Because I was familiar with HTTP and CSS, I was able to execute the job almost entirely by myself. I also have a lot of experience coding in several languages including Python, Java, C, and Swift, so I had no trouble comprehending the javascript code. I usedÂ a video from the channel "Coding with Mosh" on YouTube to help me comprehend some syntax of Javascript. Below is a link to the video.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

As I had little expirience in mostly all of this languages i.e. HTTP and CSS and for the javascript part understanding the programming logic became easier to understand as I have a good programming languages such as java, C, python etc. It were just some simple javascript syntaxs that I had to loop up for else completeing this project came with a relative ease to me. But when I was working with programming the sound effects on button clicks with javascript I faced a little problem as it was something completely new to me /////

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
 
As I saw in this particular assigned project, you could pretty much develop any web page that you desired. Are there more webdev languages which I should learn other than HTTP, Javascript, and CSS to really master the webdevelopment game? I know the applications of SQL because I did a project in a class in my curriculum on object oriented programming in web-based applications that had a lot to do with handling data of students, their courses, semesters, and so on to enroll or drop them to or from relevant curricula. But other than that, are there any other languages or applications of web development that I should take into consideration to ace my web development skills? That is something I would really like to know as I believe in always mastering the topic I take in hand.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a couple more hours to work on this project, I would use them to create a new game level that is both more difficult and enticing to the user. After the player completes the first part level, which I have submitted, they will be pushed into the next level, which will have more buttons than the previous level and each button will reveal an animal such as a dog, a cat, a tiger, a lion, and so on, rather than simply brightening the color as it did in the previous level.I would also adjust the sound effects to match the sounds of the animals on the button (I am sure I can do that with the help of some different code in javascript). In addition, unlike the first level, the user will have a restricted amount of time in this level. To make this level even more challenging and unpredictable, the program's clues would be altered every time the user attempted to rerun the same level, ensuring that the user would not be able to memorize the winning pattern and that the game would be fair.
